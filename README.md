Sizr
====

**[Pronounce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar)**

JS plugin to link sizes of DOM elements.

# Setup

The "ready to use" [script file](https://raw.github.com/guillaumervls/sizr/master/dist/sizr.min.js)
is in the `dist` folder.

*Depends on [JQuery](http://jquery.com/)*

### Classic :

```html
<script src='sizr.min.js'></script>
```

### [Browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) :
Ì€
Install : `npm install sizr`

Then :
```javascript
require('sizr')(window, $);
```

### Also works with AMD (e.g [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org))

In this case, it will depend on `jquery`.


# Use

Link the width/height of elements by giving them a group ID of your choice.
Do this with `data-` attributes in your HTML :

- `data-sizr-width-group` : ID of the group of elements you want to be the same width
- `data-sizr-height-group` : ID of the group of elements you want to be the same height

Example :
```html
<div id="el1" data-sizr-width-group="sampleGroupA"></div>
<div id="el2" data-sizr-width-group="sampleGroupA" data-sizr-height-group="sampleGroupB"></div>
<div id="el3" data-sizr-height-group="sampleGroupB"></div>

<!-- el1 and el2 will have the same width -->
<!-- el2 and el3 will have the same height -->
```

The sizing will be done automatically on page load and on page resize.
If you want to trigger it manually, just call `sizr.refresh()`.

## (Re)build
